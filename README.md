Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` for your **Weather Data Pipeline** project, which explains the functionality, setup, and usage of the pipeline:

---

# **Weather Data Pipeline**

This project fetches weather data for specific cities (currently **Gorakhpur** and **Bengaluru**) from OpenWeatherMap, processes it, stores it in a CSV file, and then generates visual comparisons for various weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.). The visualizations are saved in time-stamped folders for every 2-hour interval.

## **Prerequisites**

Before using the pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **API Key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), used for fetching weather data.
  
## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iSPYadav01/Weather_Data_Pipeline.git
   cd Weather_Data_Pipeline
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup OpenWeatherMap API key**:

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your OpenWeatherMap API key in the script `model/weather_forecast.py`.

   ```python
   API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

---

## **Usage**

Once the setup is complete, you can manually run the pipeline or automate it through GitHub Actions (or a scheduled cron job).

### **Running the Pipeline Manually**

To fetch weather data and generate visualizations:

```bash
python model/weather_forecast.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch current weather data for **Gorakhpur** and **Bengaluru** from OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Append the data to a CSV file located at `data/dataset.csv`.
3. Create a time-stamped directory inside `output/`, where a plot comparing the two cities will be saved (e.g., `output/weather_data_2024-12-31_02-00/weather_comparison_2024-12-31_02-00.png`).

### **Automating via GitHub Actions**

The pipeline can be automatically run every 2 hours using the included **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/mlops-ci.yml`). This will fetch new weather data, store it in CSV format, and generate the comparison visualizations without manual intervention.

- The **cron schedule** in the GitHub Actions file runs the workflow every 2 hours:

  ```yaml
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 */2 * * *'  # Runs every 2 hours
  ```

### **Generated Output**

Each time the pipeline runs:
1. The weather data for **Gorakhpur** and **Bengaluru** is saved in `data/dataset.csv`.
2. Visualizations showing the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and min/max temperature comparisons between the two cities are stored in the corresponding timestamped folder inside the `output/` directory.

Example output folder structure after a couple of runs:

```
output/
â”œâ”€â”€ weather_data_2024-12-31_02-00/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ weather_comparison_2024-12-31_02-00.png
â”œâ”€â”€ weather_data_2024-12-31_04-00/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ weather_comparison_2024-12-31_04-00.png
â””â”€â”€ weather_data_2024-12-31_06-00/
    â””â”€â”€ weather_comparison_2024-12-31_06-00.png
```

### **Visualizations Example**

The generated visualizations display comparisons for the following weather parameters:
- **Temperature** (Current temperature for both cities).
- **Humidity** (Percentage humidity for both cities).
- **Wind Speed** (Speed of wind in meters per second).
- **Min/Max Temperature** (Comparison between the minimum and maximum temperatures for both cities).

---

## **Dependencies**

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `requests`: To fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `matplotlib`: For generating visualizations.
- `pandas`: To handle and manipulate the data.

### Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
